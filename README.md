### DFS Problems:
### Note : we can solve below patterns using bfs also but for better readbilty we will go through dfs technique
```java
class Solution {
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        int rows = grid.length;
        int cols = grid[0].length;
        int count = 0;
        int[][] dir = new int[][]{
            {0 , -1} , {0 , +1} , {1 , 0} , {-1 , 0}
        };
        for(int i = 0 ; i < rows ; i++){
            for(int j = 0 ; j < cols; j++){
                if(grid[i][j] == '1'){
                    count++;
                    dfs(grid , i , j , dir);
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
        
    }
    public void dfs(char[][] grid, int row, int col, int[][] dir) {
        grid[row][col] = '0'; // Mark the cell as visited

        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            int nr = row + dir[i][0];
            int nc = col + dir[i][1];

            // Check if the new coordinates are within bounds and if the cell is land ('1')
            if (nr >= 0 && nr < grid.length && nc >= 0 && nc < grid[0].length && grid[nr][nc] == '1') {
                dfs(grid, nr, nc, dir);
            }
        }
    }

### ToplLogical Sort
```java
class Solution
{
    // Function to return a list containing vertices in Topological order. 
    static int[] topoSort(int V, ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj) 
    {
        // Step 1: Initialize an array to store the in-degree of each vertex
        int[] indegree = new int[V];
        
        // Calculate the in-degree of each vertex
        for(ArrayList<Integer> arr : adj) {
            for(int u : arr) {
                indegree[u]++; // Increment in-degree for each adjacent vertex
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Create a queue to hold all vertices with in-degree of 0
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        
        // Add all vertices with in-degree 0 to the queue
        for(int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            if(indegree[i] == 0) {
                queue.add(i); // Vertex with no incoming edges
            }
        }

        // Step 3: Initialize an array to store the topological order
        int[] topologicalOrder = new int[V];
        int j = 0; // Index for the topological order array
        
        // Process the queue until it's empty
        while(!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int size = queue.size(); // Get the number of vertices in the queue
            
            // Process each vertex in the current level
            for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                int u = queue.poll(); // Remove a vertex from the queue
                topologicalOrder[j++] = u; // Add it to the topological order
                
                // Decrease the in-degree of all its adjacent vertices
                for(int v : adj.get(u)) {
                    indegree[v]--; // Reduce in-degree of vertex v
                    // If in-degree of v becomes 0, add it to the queue
                    if(indegree[v] == 0) {
                        queue.add(v);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Return the final topological order
        return topologicalOrder;
    }
}
