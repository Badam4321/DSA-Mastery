# Prefix Sum Pattern 
Before diving into the prefix sum , some warm up problems for this patterns

1 . [Running Sum of 1d Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/description/)<br>
2 . [1732. Find the Highest Altitude](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-highest-altitude/description/)<br>
3 . [Find the Middle Index in Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-middle-index-in-array/description/)<br>

Given a sequence of integers a0, a1, . . . , aN−1, you will be given Q queries
of the form [L, R). For each query, compute S(L, R) = aL+aL+1+· · ·+aR−1.
